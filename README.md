Expense Tracker

A simple command-line expense tracker written in Python. This project started as a way for me to practice working with Python basics (functions, loops, file handling) and gradually grew into something that’s actually useful for tracking spending.

Features

Add expenses with amount, category, and description

View all expenses in a clean table format

See total expenses and a breakdown by category

Set budgets by category

Track how much of each budget you’ve used (and see if you’re over budget)

Data saved to CSV files (expenses.csv and budgets.csv) so it persists between runs

How to Run

Clone the repo or download the file.

Make sure you have Python 3 installed.

Run the program:

Example Usage
--- Expense Tracker ---
1. Add Expense
2. View Expenses
3. View Summary (Total & By Category)
4. Set/Update Budgets
5. View Budget Usage
6. Exit

Sample output when adding an expense:

Enter the expense amount: 50
Enter the category (Food, Rent, Fun, etc.): Food
Enter a short description: Groceries
✅ Expense saved!

Why I Built This

I wanted to create something simple but complete — a project that demonstrates working with files, handling user input, and organizing code with functions. It also helped me understand how to gradually add features (like budgets) while keeping the program clean and usable.
